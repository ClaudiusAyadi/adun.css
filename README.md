# KetoCSS

**_The lean variable-first atomic design framework!_**

---

This is my personal CSS Framework or project starter kit based on SASS (SCSS) and CSS Variables. This Framework is heavily inspired by `ACSS` ([Automatic CSS by Kevin Geary](https://automaticcss.com/)). It is the second version of my former SASS Starter Template. It simply shows my web dev learning and growth. I hope to keep working on it and make it the best.

### FEATURES

The framework includes classes for common CSS rules (e.g. grids, flex, column-counts, etc.), and tons of readily available CSS variables for nearly every property you would need in your projects.

**This is a work in progress.**

## GETTING STARTED

1. Clone the repo or download the zip file and extract it.
2. Install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Customize and make it yours:

```bash
edit keto.config.js
```

4. Start up your project:

```bash
pnpm start
```

5. Build away ðŸŽ‰

PostCSS handles everything and you don't have to do any extra configuration.

_You can use `npm` too._
